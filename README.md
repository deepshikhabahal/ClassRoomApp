# ClassRoomApp
This is a class Room Application
Overview :
Pocket ClassRoom is a video-streaming application that allows the users to watch course-specific videos. The objective of this app is to provide a platform to the students where they can watch interesting and informative videos under certain categories (Basic Subjects- Maths, Science, English, etc.). This application uses Youtube Android Player API to cache thumbnails and to play youtube videos using their Video IDs.The API helps to load and play YouTube videos (and playlists) and to customize and control the video playback experience.This application lets the user play YouTube videos or playlists within the app, that too without leaving it.

This video-streaming Classroom application will let the teacher decide what all videos should be made available to the students so that they can study accordingly. Although the teacher cannot explicitly upload the videos on the app, they can choose the videos from Youtube and mention their ids in the res file of the code(currently). However, the feature of uploading the videos on the app itself can be incorporated in the future.

This app will certainly help the teachers to congregate all the preferred videos under one roof and to centralize the attention of their students. Teachers can use this app to deliver course information/videos to the students.

Future Prospects :
Teachers can upload the videos on the app itself by clicking on a ‘+’ sign.
The user will also be provided with the option of uploading his own video on the platform. 
Can also incorporate live-interaction(online meeting).
Can make use of the Firebase Database to store all the required/essential information of the user.
Can schedule time in the calendar.
Teachers can also provide written notes.
Can add on a feature of announcements.
